## Abstract

This ultimate cosmological edition rigorously proves that the oriented right-handed trefoil knot (3₁) with self-linking number Lk = 6 is the unique stable primordial knot configuration within the Topology & Entanglement Theory (TET) framework extended to the Chern-Simons Vacuum Turbulence Lattice (CVTL).

The universe emerges as an eternal, self-correcting topological quantum simulator founded on the primordial three-leaf clover structure.
